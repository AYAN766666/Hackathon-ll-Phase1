# Implementation Plan: Task CRUD – Phase I (CLI Todo App)

**Branch**: `001-task-crud` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: [specs/001-task-crud/spec.md](../../specs/001-task-crud/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-task-crud/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a simple Python CLI Todo application that supports basic CRUD operations (Add, View, Update, Delete, Toggle Complete) with in-memory data storage. The application follows a menu-driven interface with numbered options for user interaction. All functionality is implemented using Python standard library only, with no external dependencies, and data exists only in runtime memory.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory only (no persistence to files or databases as required by constitution)
**Testing**: Python unittest module (standard library)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single project (console application)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for all operations (as specified in success criteria)
**Constraints**: Must run with `uv run`, no manual coding allowed, all code generated by Claude Code

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- All code MUST be generated by Claude Code (No manual coding)
- All functionality MUST be defined in specifications before implementation
- Specs are the single source of truth
- UV MUST be used for Python project and dependency management
- Python version MUST be 3.13 or higher
- Application MUST run as a console (CLI) program
- In-memory storage only (no databases or files)
- Follow architectural simplicity principles
- Adhere to functional completeness requirements

└── integration/
    └── test_cli.py      # CLI integration tests
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen with clear separation of concerns. Models contain data definitions, services contain business logic, and CLI contains user interface. This follows the architectural simplicity principle from the constitution.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
