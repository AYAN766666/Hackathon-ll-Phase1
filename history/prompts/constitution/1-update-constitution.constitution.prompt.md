 # Project Constitution: Evolution of Todo – Phase I

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Spec-Driven Development using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
Phase I focuses on building a simple, in-memory Python CLI Todo application generated entirely by AI.

This phase validates the developer's ability to:
- Write clear and enforceable specifications
- Guide Claude Code to generate correct software
- Avoid manual coding and boilerplate writing
- Follow clean architecture principles at a small scale

---

## 2. Scope (Phase I Only)
This constitution applies strictly to Phase I of the hackathon.

Included:
- Python command-line Todo application
- In-memory task storage (no database, no files)
- Single-user usage
- Basic CRUD functionality

Excluded:
- Web interfaces
- Databases or persistence
- Authentication
- AI agents or chatbot features
- Cloud or containerization

---

## 3. Development Rules
The following rules are mandatory:

1. All code MUST be generated by Claude Code.
2. Manual coding is strictly prohibited.
3. All functionality MUST be defined in specifications before implementation.
4. Specs are the single source of truth.
5. UV MUST be used for Python project and dependency management.
6. Python version MUST be 3.13 or higher.
7. The application MUST run as a console (CLI) program.

Violating any rule invalidates the phase submission.

---

## 4. Architectural Principles
- Simple, readable, and modular Python code
- Clear separation of concerns
- No over-engineering
- No premature abstractions
- Deterministic and predictable CLI behavior

---

## 5. Functional Requirements
The application MUST support the following features:

1. Add Task
   - Title (required)
   - Description (optional)

2. View Tasks
   - List all tasks
   - Display task ID, title, and completion status

3. Update Task
   - Update title and/or description by task ID

4. Delete Task
   - Remove a task by task ID

5. Mark Task Complete / Incomplete
   - Toggle completion status by task ID

---

## 6. Data Model
Each task MUST contain:
- Unique integer ID
- Title
- Description
- Completion status (completed / not completed)

All data MUST exist only in memory during runtime.

---

## 7. User Interface
- Interaction MUST occur via command-line input
- Clear prompts and messages MUST be shown
- Errors MUST be handled gracefully (e.g., invalid ID)

---

## 8. Quality Standards
- Code MUST be readable and maintainable
- Functions MUST be small and focused
- No unused code
- No commented-out code

---

## 9. Verification
Phase I is considered complete when:
- The CLI application runs successfully
- All five required features work correctly
- The repository contains full spec history
- No manual code changes are present

---

## 10. Evolution Constraint
This constitution is immutable for Phase I.
Future phases may extend this constitution but must not violate it.
```

## Response snapshot

Created and updated the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the provided content. The constitution now includes:

1. Core Principles section with 6 principles covering:
   - Purpose-Driven Development
   - Scope Adherence
   - Development Rule Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   - Architectural Simplicity
   - Functional Completeness
   - Data Model Consistency

2. Additional sections:
   - User Interface Requirements
   - Quality Standards
   - Verification Criteria
   - Governance

3. Updated related templates to align with the new constitution:
   - Updated `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to include specific constitution check requirements
   - Updated `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to include functional requirements aligned with the constitution
   - Updated `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` to reflect Python/UV requirements

The constitution is version 1.0.0 and has been properly formatted with a sync impact report at the top.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created project constitution and updated related templates
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution and 3 templates
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to create spec for the todo application
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guidance for the todo app development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create the initial spec for the todo application
